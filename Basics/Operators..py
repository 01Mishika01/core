##comparison operators
'''a = 10
b = 20
print("a > b is ",a > b)
print("a < b is ",a < b)
print("a == b is ",a == b)
print("a != b is ",a != b)'''

##Logical operators
'''a = True
b = False
print("a and b is", a and b)
print("a or b is", a or b)
print("not b is", not b)'''

##Identity operators
'''a = 100
b = 100.0
print("a is b", a is b)
print("a is not b", a is not b)'''

##Membership operators
'''a = [1,2,3,4]
b = 10
print(b in a)'''
